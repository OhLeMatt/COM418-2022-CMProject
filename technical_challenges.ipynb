    "During the spring semester 2022, we had to develop a project for EPFL's Master course **Computer and Music** (COM-418) given by ***Prof. Paolo Prandoni***. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposal was to create a software tool capable of:\n",
    "* Reading, visualizing and playing MIDI files' music.\n",
    "* Suggesting and showing related musical knowledge for improvisation in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part essentially requires to have regular MIDI files. Since we wish not to edit music data at display time, we needed to preprocess it correctly. To do so, we had to discover the MIDI standard and how people usually use it to come up with a reasonable design to regularize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part is more vast and opens on several subjects we decided to tackle. \n",
    "\n",
    "One central rule of music composition is to write *in* a musical scale. In other words, composers decide to more or less follow a predefined set of notes that guarantees a musical coherence. Same can be used in improvisation: once you detect the scale being played, you can accompagny the music more easily.<br/>\n",
    "Hence, we decided to implement a *Scale and Chord Suggestion System* with visualization to help the user discover this information analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, we first created an abstraction that embodies scales. Then, we tried representing known scales such as *Diatonic Modes* or *Harmonic Minor* for example. But we realized that it could be more interesting to explore beyond the generally well known scope and cover more possibilites.  <br/>\n",
    "Thus, we looked online to find an interesting database and connect it with our abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, remained the two main technical challenges, creating an experimental metric to grade scale/chords relevancy for a set of played notes (in real-time).\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered most of our objectives at last-minute, and realized how time-consuming it is to develop an experimental app on such short time window. We can easily say that half of the time was used for UI conception. On the other hand, being able to test with UI is also very rewarding. There are some potential severe bugs that you can encounter in our program if you do excessive/abusive sequences of actions. We hope it will work well on your machine (all mentioned modules here are implicitely those found in `music_tools`)\n",

    "##### We realized pretty soon that MIDI usages were really versatile. On data-side, it results in different structures that sometimes displease us. To cope with that, we created a class to manipulate decompressed MIDI with more ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aspects of MIDI are to communicates message-instance of information to alter notes and parameters on diverse devices and/or softwares. It proposes a very large panel of possibilites but also suffer from its advantages: content may look quite chaotic.<br/>\n",
    "There is a system with 256 potential tracks playing on 16 distinct channels. It can only process 16 channels at once. It implies that for more than 16 musical tracks we are forced to at least use twice the same channel in the simplest case. On the other hand, some of these tracks may be present only for meta messages (not directly notes). They can alter pitch, tempo, time signatures, program parameters, etc... <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, two kinds of extreme are possible:\n",
    "* A midifile with 25 musical tracks spanning on only 3 channels with 12 meta tracks\n",
    "* A midifile with a single track spanning on the 16 channels with all the meta information. \n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy the situation, we decided to extract all data as whole and dispacthing it:\n",
    "* Either, we dispatch musical messages per channels.\n",
    "* Either, we dispatch meta messages in one meta-track.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we receive in any situation at most 17 tracks: 1 meta-track and 16 tracks for each channel.\n",
    "Surely, it may compact previously separated tracks (2 hands on piano on 2 tracks playing 1 channel, becomes a single track), but it offers a peace of mind to continue developping the other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is described by the `\"dispatched\"` mode used by default in our class: `midi_frame.MidiFrame` (it also have a mode to leave data intact `\"all\"`, and another to filter out unrelevant tracks \"`filtered`\") <br/>\n",
    "It takes for input a `mido.Midifile`, which give us the decompressed raw data.\n",
    "We also use `pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI` class to synthesize the audio if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare below, the execution of the `dispatched` midiframe and the `all` midiframe (you may need to increase you print length size)."

    "We realized that the occidental music world simplifies our task a lot with the paradigm of the 12 unique chromatic tones. This reduces a \"scale\" to a permutations of notes among 12 choices, in other words 4096 possibilities.<br/>\n",
    "Among them we thought it would be more relevant to only consider combinations with 5 or above notes.<br/>\n",
    "12 on/off choices also means we can script scales as a binary number which also a unique scale id representation: for example Major pattern is 101011010101 becomes in decimal 2766.\n",
    "It was with a great pleasure that we realized that this system was used broadly by many people/datasets on internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, using a scale with an explicit tonic is simply a **roll** of the scale among the 12 indices. Similarly, certain scales are **rotations** of others: for examples all the diatonic modes *Major(Ionian), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Natural Minor(Aeolian), Locrian* are the same and only pattern, rotated by a certain shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make all this knowledge take shape we created `GeneralScale` and `Scale` classes (in `scales` module).<br/>\n",
    "* `GeneralScale` is the pattern representation of scale. It doesn't take any tonic as we are only interested in its \"pure\" intervals.\n",

On the reverse, it is not exactly a \"tree\", because one node can have several parents. But still with condition that they are the closest in set-difference (this is exploited in the UI with **parents scales** and **children scales** ans also available in `Scale`, `GeneralScale` API). We thought of using this structure to optimize our computations for scale suggestions, but it revealed uneeded.\n",

    "* We pass the counts and sum we just computed\n",
    "* We pass the allowed tonic chromas (was left as a feature but never altered, it will always take the 12 chromas)\n",

    "Each scales is decomposed as its bitmap in an array (for example, Major -> `[1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]`) then rolled and repeated for each tonic chroma.\n",
    "This way we can compute sort of correlations with the counts shown just before by doing scalar product with scale vectors.\n",
    "For example:  `[0,30,0,0,18,0,18,0,18,14,0,24] @ [1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1] = 56`\n",

If the played notes completely fell off, you minimize the score. This implies that Chromatic Scale will always have a score of 100%, which is undesirable.\n",
    "* `matching`: To cope with the aforementioned problem, we add the `matching` to compensate for the fact that even though played notes have perfect score with the scale, it is maybe matching less than necessary. This metric consists in takin one minus the absolute differences between the chromatic note presence and the scale notes appearance divided by the largest possible matching difference with the scale note count. It tries to answer the question how perfectly we fall **only** among the scale notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We multiply both metrics to get a fair accuracy and we should have a long list of len(tonic_chromas) * len(general_scale_susbet) in principle.\n",
    "We then reshape the result to make it match in row the scales, and in columns the tonic_chromas.\n",
    "We have accuracy for every input possibility (scale, tonic) and just need to compare them afterward to find the best."
